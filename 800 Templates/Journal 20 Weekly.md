### Analysis
**How much work in minutes did it did you complete last week? Does this amount seem realistic? If you worked every day for 8 hours for 7 days, you would have worked 56 hours, or 3,360 minutes.  If you had part-time for 4 days which cut working hours down to 4 hours, you would have worked 1,920 minute.**
[[Work-Minutes Last 7 Days]]
`Answer here.`

**How does this work compare to the previous week? Do you think the difference is significant?**
[[Work-Minutes Last 7-14 Days]]
`Answer here.`

### Reflection
**What do you think worked this week to get that much work done?**
`Answer here.`

**What do you think didn't work well this week to get that much work done?**
`Answer here.`

**How can you potentially increase Velocity (get more work done)?**
`Answer here.`

**What would stunt this increase, or even lower Velocity?**
`Answer here.`

**What's the likelihood of this concern occurring?**
`Answer here.`

**How much of an impact would this stunt or lowering Velocity?**
`Answer here.`

**What will you do to prevent or mitigate the stunting or lowering when it happens?**
`Answer here.`

**For each [[Projects|Project]] that you touched last week, does its Objective still align with most of its [[Disciplines|Discipline]] [[Pillars]]? Does the Objective align with the Discipline Dynamic? How and why?**

## Concerns
**What are at least two things to worry about next week?**
1. What's the likelihood of this concern occurring? 
2. How would this impact you? 
3. What will you do to prevent this from happening, or at least mitigate the damage when it occurs?

### Concern 1: `Title of Concern`
