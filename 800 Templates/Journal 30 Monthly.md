### Analysis
**How much work in minutes did it did you complete last month? Does this amount seem realistic?**
> If you worked every day for 8 hours in a 28 month-day, you would have worked 13,440 minutes. If you had part-time for 4 out of 7 days of the week in that 28 day month, and those part-time days only allowed for 4 hours of work, you would have worked 10,560 minutes.

[[Work-Minutes Last 1 Months]]
`Answer here.`

**How does this work compare to the previous months? Do you think this difference is significant?**
[[Work-Minutes Last 1-2 Months]]
`Answer here.`

### Reflection
**What do you think worked this month to get that much work done?**
`Answer here.`

**What do you think didn't work well this month to get that much work done?**
`Answer here.`

**How can you potentially increase Velocity (get more work done)?**
`Answer here.`

**What would stunt this increase, or even lower Velocity?**
`Answer here.`

**What's the likelihood of this concern occurring?**
`Answer here.`

**How much of an impact would this stunt or lowering Velocity?**
`Answer here.`

**What will you do to prevent or mitigate the stunting or lowering when it happens?**
`Answer here.`

## Alignment
```dataview
TABLE WITHOUT ID
	link(file.name, default(link(file.name).aliases, link(file.name).name)) as "Discipline",
	pillars as "Pillars",
	dynamic as "Dynamic"
FROM #note/discipline and -"999 Stale" and -"Templates"
SORT due asc
```
**For each Discipline, how are you feeling about them at the moment? Do they still feel relevant and important through your Life Pillars?**
### `Discipline 1`
`Answer here.`

### `Discipline 2`
`Answer here.`

## Concerns
**What are at least two things to worry about next month?**
1. What's the likelihood of this concern occurring? 
2. How would this impact you? 
3. What will you do to prevent this from happening, or at least mitigate the damage when it occurs?

### Concern 1: `Title of Concern`
`Elaborate concern here`

### Concern 2: `Title of Concern`
`Elaborate concern here`

## Ramblings
