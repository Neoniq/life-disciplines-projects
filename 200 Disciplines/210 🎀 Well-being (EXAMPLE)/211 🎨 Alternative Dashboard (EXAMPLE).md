[[210 ðŸŽ€ Well-being (EXAMPLE)]]
# ðŸŽ¨ Alternative Dashboard (EXAMPLE)
Fiddle-dee-doo, here is a dashboard that has some other relevant information specifically for working with this discipline.

This can be an extension of [[210 ðŸŽ€ Well-being (EXAMPLE)]] or something entirely different. 

For example, you can house all of your tasks in here instead of having them be in the first note. You can do this for projects as well.
