# ðŸ”€ Divergence to Disciplines
This document serves to explore understand what's important and relevant to your life in the form of [[Disciplines]]. This will also help you set up the initial files and folders for this system of Life Discipline Projects.

## Exploration by Diverging Ideas
For each section, roughly answer in the context of relevancy and importance to you. *This document is focused on you, not others.*

**Using that definition, what are the everyday ideas or activities you love? Please make a generic list.**

### Skill
**What is your definition of being skilled at something?**

## Condensing to Disciplines
**Using all of your *listed* activities and ideas above, list all of them below.**

**Please review [[Disciplines#Scoping|Discipline]] and [[Ikigai]]. Do a first pass of all listed ideas above and start to group them into generic Disciplines.**
Discipline 1
- Activity 1

**Go take a break, preferably full day and minimally a meal break.**
- [ ] I took a break to refresh my mind to have a fresh perspective when I come back

**Copy and paste your groupings above below. Please review and adjust accordingly. Feel free to rename the Disciplines, add new relevant and important activities/ideas, etc.**
Discipline 1
- Activity 1

## Finalizing
**What are your finalized, grouped Disciplines from this exercise? What characteristics of Ikigai do these Disciplines have (love, world, money, skill)?**
`Answer`

## Next Steps
When you are done, please make folders for Disciplines under `100 Disciplines/`. Their folder names should be prefixed with a prefix number, where the second digit denotes this discipline's number. **The first digit will always be 1** and the last a 0, inherited from `100 Disciplines`.

It's set like this to have redundancy when typing references to specific Disciplines. You can either type the Discipline itself or type its Discipline prefix number. Have I found this function useful? Time will tell, but it's set up like this for now.

Once the folder is created, you need to set up the Discipline files. Run the `QuickAdd: Create Discipline` command. It will ask you for input in the following order. *Source refers to the name of what you're creating.*
1. The path of the folder you made earlier
2. What is the Discipline Prefix Number? (first two digits)
3. The source emoji (e.g. ðŸŽŽ)
4. The source base name (e.g. Well-Being)
5. The Discipline tag (1 followed by the discipline's number)

You now have actionable items that make way towards meeting and sustaining your Life Pillars. But with our limited time and efforts, we need to have a focused Discipline, something that gives our lives meaning. See [[02 ðŸ”‚ Convergence to Ikigai|Convergence to Ikigai]]
