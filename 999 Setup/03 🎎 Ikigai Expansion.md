# ðŸŽŽ Ikigai Expansion
Based on your process from on [[02 ðŸ”‚ Convergence to Ikigai|ðŸ”» Convergence to Ikigai]], this is your chosen Ikigai(s).
```dataview
TABLE WITHOUT ID
	link(file.name, default(aliases, name)) as "Chosen Ikigai"
FROM #note/ikigai 
```

We will now begin to expand on them below. Make sure for your Ikigai Disciplines that you thoroughly define their Discipline Pillars, and Dynamic on its Dashboard. Relevance and Importance is useful but not required, as it will be further expanded here.

## Your Choice
**Why did you decide to choose this Discipline as your Ikigai?**
`Answer`

## The Past
**For this Discipline, do you feel like you or the world meets all the Ikigai characteristics? Be thorough. Ikigai characteristics framed as questions are as follows.**
**What brought you to love?**
`Answer`

**What have you gone through to be like this in this field?**
`Answer`

**What has the world gone through to need it?**
`Answer`

**How has it come to the point that people are paying for it?**
`Answer`

**Objectively, from an outsider looking in, would they agree with what you said above? Consider asking another person.
**
`Answer`

## The Present
**How strongly does your current view of your Ikigai Discipline's Pillars align with your Life Pillars? What about their Dynamics? Do you think this is a good thing? Why?
**
`Answer`

**Are you partaking in this Discipline yet? What are you doing? 
**
`Answer`

**If you're not partaking in it, what's blocking you from actively pursuing this Discipline? What can you do right now?
**
`Answer`

## The Future
**Long-term goals are a double-edged sword because once they are met, velocity and direction disappear. One solution is to play the infinite game. This is a lesson from Simon Sinek's book, The Infinite Game, which observes that naive business operate towards an end-goal, but the most successful operate as an infinite game. Does your Ikigai Discipline have pillars and a discipline that have considered infinite potential for growth?**
`Answer`

> If your answer does not allow room for sufficient growth, especially over your lifetime, you should reconsider redefining this Discipline.

**What will you do right now to make velocity towards your Ikigai Discipline?**
`Answer`

## Epilogue
This is the end of this life management setup. You should have a better idea of what your Ikigai Discipline means to you. You should consider doing another pass on its **`Relevance and Importance`** section to further flesh it out.

You also should have noticed that your Ikigai Discipline should have mostly aligned with your Life Pillars. If they are not, it may cause some conflict in the future.

Everything is now setup. You can archive `999 Setup` into `900 Archive` for historical data. 

Start making Projects that align with Disciplines to create velocity towards your Ikigai.

To make a project, first create a folder for it under its corresponding Discipline. No need to number it. Then create the initial files by running the command `QuickAdd: Create New Project`. It will ask for the following.
1. Path of project folder
2. Project emoji name
3. Name of project
4. Corresponding discipline tag
5. Link to the discipline note
6. Number prefix (enter 0)
