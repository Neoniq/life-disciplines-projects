# ðŸ’— Defining Life
## Life Pillars
Life Pillars are [[Pillars]] under the context of everyday Life. They give Life meaning and direction and should be defined in the most generalized, fundamental form as possible. In other words, your objective is not that you not need a hammer and nail to hang a picture, it's that you need to make something visible.

You can have any amount of Life Pillars, but do consider having just a handful so you can always remember them.

When you have something in mind, go to [[99 ðŸ’— Life#Life Pillars]] and begin to define and thoroughly elaborate on them.

If you're unsure of your own Life Pillars, consider the following questions under the context of your sense of self. They should get some thoughts flowing. Also, if applicable, consider their opposite and question if it's something that should even matter to begin with.
- What comes first?
- What does it mean to live?
- What do you want before you die?
- What does it mean to be human?
- What deserves respect and appreciation?
- Do you value the journey or the end?
- What are your limits?
- Why are you even doing this right now?
- What is your version of hell? Of heaven?

## Life Dynamic
Life Dynamic is the emerging result of the combined effects of your Life Pillars. Pillars are the founding principles of what make you, you. They all pull you towards some direction, and this direction should agree with what you want. You could consider this your personality. That being said, your Life Dynamic should align with the Life Pillars you defined above.

Your Life Discipline should be summarized into one sentence, and should thoroughly describe a personality. This is a personality that you currently are or strive to be.

Look over your Life Pillars and Life Discipline. Really ponder over if it's something that resonates with you. Make revisions as needed.

One you feel it's more or less finalized, on the frontmatter of [[99 ðŸ’— Life|ðŸ’— Life]], under `pillars`, please list your Pillars followed by a one sentence abstraction. Similarly, under `dynamic`, type your Life Dynamic. It should look similar to the following.
```YAML
pillars:
  - "Some pillar: yada yada"
  - "Sharing Experiences: joy is better experiened with others to spead knowledge"
dynamic: "Pillars combine to create a hard-tempered, refined individual who's passionate about sharing novel experiences to supplement joy in the life the life of others who might not be able to experience joy."
```
