# ðŸ”‚ Convergence to Ikigai
This document serves to condense your Disciplines and define your single (or very small set) of [[Ikigai]].

To start with, for each Discipline, please make sure you answer the section **`Importance and Relevance.`** Also make sure you set proper YAML `ikigai` value(s). These values should reflect what you listed at the bottom of [[01 ðŸ”€ Divergence to Disciplines|ðŸ”€ Divergence to Disciplines]]. 

They can be any combination or none of the following.
```YAML
ikigai:
  - world
  - love
  - money
  - skill
```

## Your Life Through Disciplines
### Fundamental
This is the basis of what gives meaning to you. Everything else will build off of these fundamentals.

#### Love
```dataview
TABLE WITHOUT ID link(file.name, file.aliases) as "Discipline", dynamic as "Dynamic"
FROM "100 Disciplines"
WHERE contains(tags, "note/discipline") and contains(ikigai, "love")
```
#### World
```dataview
TABLE WITHOUT ID link(file.name, file.aliases) as "Discipline", dynamic as "Dynamic"
FROM "100 Disciplines"
WHERE contains(tags, "note/discipline") and contains(ikigai, "world")
```
#### Money
```dataview
TABLE WITHOUT ID link(file.name, file.aliases) as "Discipline", dynamic as "Dynamic"
FROM "100 Disciplines"
WHERE contains(tags, "note/discipline") and contains(ikigai, "money")
```
#### Skill
```dataview
TABLE WITHOUT ID link(file.name, file.aliases) as "Discipline", dynamic as "Dynamic"
FROM "100 Disciplines"
WHERE contains(tags, "note/discipline") and contains(ikigai, "skill")
```

### Dynamic 1
This is the first layer of the emerging effect of 2 fundamental characteristics.

#### Mission 
Defined as what you love and what the world needs.
```dataview
TABLE WITHOUT ID link(file.name, file.aliases) as "Discipline", dynamic as "Dynamic"
FROM "100 Disciplines"
WHERE contains(tags, "note/discipline") and contains(ikigai, "love") and contains(ikigai, "world")
```
#### Vocation
Defined as what the world needs and what you can be paid for.
```dataview
TABLE WITHOUT ID link(file.name, file.aliases) as "Discipline", dynamic as "Dynamic"
FROM "100 Disciplines"
WHERE contains(tags, "note/discipline") and contains(ikigai, "money") and contains(ikigai, "world")
```
#### Profession
Defined as what you can be paid for and what you are skilled at.
```dataview
TABLE WITHOUT ID link(file.name, file.aliases) as "Discipline", dynamic as "Dynamic"
FROM "100 Disciplines"
WHERE contains(tags, "note/discipline") and contains(ikigai, "love") and contains(ikigai, "skill")
```
#### Passion
Defined as what you are skilled at and what you love.
```dataview
TABLE WITHOUT ID link(file.name, file.aliases) as "Discipline", dynamic as "Dynamic"
FROM "100 Disciplines"
WHERE contains(tags, "note/discipline") and contains(ikigai, "love") and contains(ikigai, "skill")
```

### Dynamic 2
These are the second emerging layer of 3 fundamental characteristics. These are Disciplines that are almost there, but are missing something to feel complete.

#### Useless Satisfaction
These are the cool things in life that don't serve a higher purpose other than being cool. You love these things, they make you money, and you're skilled in it, but that's all to it.
```dataview
TABLE WITHOUT ID link(file.name, file.aliases) as "Discipline", dynamic as "Dynamic"
FROM "100 Disciplines"
WHERE contains(tags, "note/discipline") and contains(ikigai, "love") and contains(ikigai, "skill") and contains(ikigai, "money")
```

#### Empty Comfort
You can think of these as things you need to do, but aren't particularly fond of. They get the bills paid, you're genuinely being useful to others, and you just happen to be good at it.
```dataview
TABLE WITHOUT ID link(file.name, file.aliases) as "Discipline", dynamic as "Dynamic"
FROM "100 Disciplines"
WHERE contains(tags, "note/discipline") and contains(ikigai, "world") and contains(ikigai, "skill") and contains(ikigai, "money")
```

#### Uncertain Excitement
These are things that you know are genuinely useful, that you love, and that you know you can be compensated for. However, you have yet to acquire the skills required to do so. **This is something you can aim for with sufficient training.**
```dataview
TABLE WITHOUT ID link(file.name, file.aliases) as "Discipline", dynamic as "Dynamic"
FROM "100 Disciplines"
WHERE contains(tags, "note/discipline") and contains(ikigai, "world") and contains(ikigai, "love") and contains(ikigai, "money")
```

#### Valueless Delight
You love doing these things. People understand its significance and recognize that you're a pioneer at this. However, they this is something that isn't really sustainable financially.
```dataview
TABLE WITHOUT ID link(file.name, file.aliases) as "Discipline", dynamic as "Dynamic"
FROM "100 Disciplines"
WHERE contains(tags, "note/discipline") and contains(ikigai, "skill") and contains(ikigai, "love") and contains(ikigai, "money")
```

### Potential Ikigai
Below are your primary driving forces of life, your Ikigai. They are things you love, what the world needs, what you get money for, and what you are skilled at.
```dataview
TABLE WITHOUT ID link(file.name, file.aliases) as "Discipline", dynamic as "Dynamic"
FROM "100 Disciplines"
WHERE contains(tags, "note/discipline") and length(ikigai) = 4
```

## Selecting your Ikigai(s)
You may find that you have multiple Ikigai. However, it's important to direct your attention to one, if not a very sparse amount, at a time. Truly touching and exercising all fundamental characteristics of a Discipline to sustain Ikigai takes commitment, requiring your limited time and effort.

> While it's possible to choose Disciplines that are not Potential Ikigais, understand that it will require the initial investment of time and effort to fulfill the missing Ikigai characteristics.

Now's the time to also reflect on what you wrote down under the Discipline's **`Importance and Relevance`** section.

So, what will be your Primary Ikigai(s)?

For your selected Ikigai, please add to its note tags: `#note/ikigai`

When done, it should appear below in preview mode.

## Next Steps
Your Ikigai is now set. This will be your focus moving forwards. Your Ikigai may change in the future, and if so you can always come back here. But we need to take action now. We need to further understand what makes this Ikigai Discipline resonate with us. See [[03 ðŸŽŽ Ikigai Expansion|ðŸŽŽ Ikigai Expansion]]
