# Planned Tasks
**Planned Tasks** are [[Tasks]] that are set to be worked on soon, preferably sometime today. They are tagged with `#planned`.

You should only have about 5 planned tasks at any time to prevent [[Decision Paralysis]], increase approachability, and reduce [[Friction]].

An example of a planned task is as follows.
