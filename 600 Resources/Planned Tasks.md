# Planned Tasks
**Planned Tasks** are [[Tasks]] that are set to be worked on soon, preferably sometime today. They are tagged with `#planned`.

You should only have about 5 planned tasks at any time to prevent [[Decision Paralysis]] when figuring out what to do. You can pull these tasks from anything ([[Projects]], [[Disciplines]], etc).
