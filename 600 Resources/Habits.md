# Habits
**Habits** are regular practices or routines that are small and easy, and are part of a bigger system of personal compound growth.

Habits stick once they are performed subconsciously, but this may take anywhere between 18-254 days. The key is consistency and exposure through a system that includes, but is not limited to:
- Active and Passive Reminders
- Progress Tracking
- [[Fundamentals of LDP#Alignment]]

For implementation within Obsidian, consider checking out [[Tasks as Habits in Obsidian]].
