### Dashboards
Dashboards are the master note for whatever it serves. They can hold the core information of something, as well as be an extremely low-[[Friction]] portal into your work. When one is ready to do work, they should be able to take a glance at a dashboard and immediately understand to work on, as well as its general context.

There should be one for [[Life (LDP)|Life]], all [[Disciplines]], and all [[Projects]]. They can also be used in tandem with [[Simple Integration Into Obsidian#Obsidian Plugins]].

See [[00 🏠 Main Dashboard|🏠 Main Dashboard]] for an example of low-friction portal. See [[210 🎀 Well-being (EXAMPLE)]] for an example of holding core information, as well as being a portal to work.
