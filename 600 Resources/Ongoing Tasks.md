# Ongoing Tasks
**When should I tag a `#task` as `#ongoing`?**
Tasks should be tagged as `#ongoing` when they are planned to be worked on right now (today). There should only be 3 to 5 tasks ongoing at any time. If you finish them early, feel free to add more, but don't overload yourself at the start of your day; your can discourage yourself and begin to procrastinate at your work load.

Tasks tagged as `#ongoing` should never have their tag taken off except in the event the task is absolutely no longer relevant or something else has taken true priority over this task (e.g. something else is blocking this task). This is to stay determined and prevent switching over to what is immediately curious or satisfying.
