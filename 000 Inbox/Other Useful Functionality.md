## Other Useful Functionality
There are a lot of neat little things that can make your workflow easier. Here's a very sparse list of small productivity hacks in this Vault. Some are set to keybinds that work for me, and I highly suggest you set them to something that works for you.
-  **Hotkeys for starred files:** press `ALT` + `SHIFT` + `1` to immediately open the first starred note in a new pane. You can exclude shift to open it on this pane. If you don't like the hotkey, feel free to change it.
-  **Obsidian Task Archiver:** immediately move all finished `Task` to a header named `Archived`
-  **Natural Language Dates:** Need to quickly enter today's date? Type `@today` then type enter. This works for other natural datas, such as `@in 2 days`. Use this everywhere.
-  **Templater**: LDP uses templates. One thing that it can do is quickly set up a task with defined values. See [[task]] as a quick example. It assumes you already made the line into a task by pressing `CTRL` + `ENTER`.
-  **Note Refactor:** A plugin to quickly refactor notes. I binded it to `CTRL` + `SHIFT` + `M` to refactor and use the first line as the header.
-  **Hotkeys++**: Quickly swap a line of text up and down with `ALT` + `W` or `S`. Useful for quickly organizing Tasks.
-  **Sort and Permute Lines:** Quickly sort selected lines alphabetically. Applicable for tasks to sort alphabetically to sort by reverse priority, then reverse the sort to sort by priority. Not essential but still useful.
-  **Emojis:** There's a plugin for it (not installed). If you're on Windows, pressing `WIN` + `.` will bring up an emoji menu. Type emojis and add that special jazz to your workflow.
-  **Open Daily Note $\rightarrow$ Quick Ramblings:** Have something on your mind? `CTRL` + `T` will bring you to your daily journal to ramble on about things.
-  **`#resume` Tag:** Use the `#resume` tag to quickly bookmark a location to come back to it later when you have time. On the [[90 üóÉÔ∏è Master Backlog|üè† Main Dashboard]] there's an embeded search query for it. If you click on it, it should bring you immediately back to your work (hopefully). You should add context before you call it a day and add this tag.
