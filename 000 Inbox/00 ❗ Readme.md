# Hello!
Welcome to Life-Disciplines-Projects (LDP) is a life-management framework built within [Obsidian](https://obsidian.md/) by [uwi](https://twitter.com/uwidev). It takes inspriation from [[Getting Things Done]], [[Agile Project Management]] and it's derivatives ([[Scrum (Agile)|Scrum]], [[Kanban (Agile)|Kanban]]), [[Ikigai]], [[Pillars, Pipelines, Vaults (PPV)]].

**I have provided all of this content for free, so please consider donating to me at [ko-fi](https://ko-fi.com/uwidev) when you have the chance.**

This note serves to explain the fundamental theory of LDP. 

## Preface
### Who is this for?
LDP is a life-management framework for individuals who would like to create mobiliy towards what they want to acheive in their lifetime. It requires a moderate amount of setup to work properly, but it is possible to forgo this if one has already fleshed out their life values.

If you're looking for an out-of-the-box complete system right away, this may not be for you.

This framework can be applied outside of Obsidian if desired.
