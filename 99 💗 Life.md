## Life Pillars
### (Example) Empathy
Specifically, the Golden Rule: treat others the way you want to be treated. Empathy is the capacity to understand and feel what another person is experiencing. In a way, it's the ability to project the humanity of another person into yourself. 

#### (Example) Relevance and Importance
The Golden Rule has been drilled into my head from elementary school. This mindset is something that I continue to do, and it has helped me empathize with many others around me, especially so given my introvert-personality. I feel like it has given me many social insights and perspectives.

I'd consider this Pillar important because to be socially accepted, you have to be very socially aware of the circumstances leading up to it. It also in a way feels more human since you supposedly put another person's sense of humanity front and center to understand and feel with them, not for them. Doing this just feels right.

### Pillar
`Abstraction`

#### Relevance and Importance
`Why is it relevant?`

`Why is it important?`

## Life Dynamic
in one sentence, what kind of person do these pillars combine to make?

## Action
for each pillar, what discipline(s) will allow mobility towards supporting that pillar?
