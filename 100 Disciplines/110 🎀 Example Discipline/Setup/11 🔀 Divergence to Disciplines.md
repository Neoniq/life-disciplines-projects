# üîÄ Divergence to Disciplines
This document serves to explore understand what's important and relevant to your life in the form of Disciplines. This will also help you set up the initial files and folders for this system of Life Discipline Projects.

## Initial Thinking
[[Disciplines]] are the context in which action will be taken to mobilize yourself and  generate velocity towards your Life Dynamic and Life Pillars. These contexts can be as broad as the study and practice of **Health** to the *specifics* of **Ramen Noodles**. It's mainly a matter of depth and perspective. To an extremely nuanced individual, they may see the latter Ramen Noodles as something flawed with infinite room for improvement.

That being said, how you scope and define your Disciplines is entirely up to its relevance and importance to you. They should at least be scoped wide enough such that, in the end, all Disciplines have no major overlap in context. That is, Mental Health and Physical Health should be merged into Health because both directly affect each other.

Some examples of Disciplines might be as follows.
- **Well-being**: includes all aspects of health, happiness, longevity, and quality of life
- **Finance**: because money is money
- **Human**: to better understand what it means to be a good human being
- **Art**: catch-all for all your creative outlooks

The Discipline must be relevant and important to you.

> Try to keep the number of Disciplines you generate in the single digits. Reaching double digits, or even getting close to it, means that you need to combine the Disciplines more. Imagine having to always maintain your skills for 9 completely different instruments where the skills don't transfer from one instrument to the other, and the note scales differs on each. Just combine them to a generic "Music" to make room for other Disciplines. The only exception is when you are literally the exception.

## Exploration by Diverging Ideas
Here, we will begin to explore some fundamental driving forces of what usually makes a Discipline fulfilling, by means of [[Ikigai]]. Remember, this is what *you* believe, not what others believe. Take as much or as little time as needed, just know what's important to you. **Always take into account your Life Pillars and Life Disciplines.**

### Love
#### What does it mean to love an everyday idea and activity? It may help to define the opposite as well.
`Answer`

#### Using your answer above, what are the everyday ideas or activities you love? What is it that you love about it? Try to make the activities unique from each other.
`Answer`

### Skill
#### What is your definition of being skilled at something?
`Answer`

#### Using that definition, what are some skills that you have? How are you skilled? List and scope these skills as general or as specific as you'd like. Try not have skillsets overlap each other.
`Answer`

### Money
#### What items you can make or services you can provide that you think someone would pay for? Why would someone pay for it
`Answer`

#### What is your definition of being minimally financially stable?
`Answer`

#### Using that definition, what activities can you semi-confidently say will make you reach that minimally financially stability?
`Answer`

#### In the far future, you probably have greater ideas (e.g. Family, Housing, Cars, etc). What activities do you think will actually help you reach them within a reasonable timeframe?
`Answer`

### World
#### What do you know the world needs?
`Answer`

#### What do you think is missing, but the world has not yet realized?
`Answer`

#### Using your answers above, what activities do you believe fulfill the needs of the world? How so?
`Answer`

## Condensing to Disciplines
**Review all of your answers above. Below, generate a list of activities that you found to be relevant and important. Feel free to delete duplicates and rename activities as needed.**
`Answer`

**Please review [[Disciplines#Scoping|Discipline]] and [[Ikigai]]. Iterate on your list above and start to group them into generic but dinstinct Disciplines. You may find it useful if you use the some kind of Card Sorting. A Kanban Board may be useful here.**
`Answer`

**Go take a break, preferably full day and minimally a meal break.**
- [ ] I took a break to refresh my mind to have a fresh perspective when I come back

**Copy and paste your groupings above, below. Please review and adjust accordingly. Feel free to rename the Disciplines, add new relevant and important activities/ideas, etc. Remember, you want single digit Discilines with distinct skillsets required in each.**
`Answer`

## Finalizing
**What are your finalized, grouped Disciplines from this exercise? What characteristics of Ikigai do these Disciplines have (love, world, money, skill)?**
`Answer`

## Initial Creation
When you are done, make folders for Disciplines under `100 Disciplines/`. Consider naming them following [[00 ‚ùó Readme#Folder Naming]], but just consider it, don't do it quite yet. You may find that you want it ordered differently after finishing setup.

Once the folder is created, create a Dashboard that will serve as the master note for that Discipline. Name it whatever you want, but I suggest havng it the same as the folder name.

## Fleshing Disciplines
For each Discipline dashboard, add minimally the following information.
- A short abstract of what this discipline is
- Why and how this discipline is relevant and important 

Feel free to add more. Pillars and Dynamics are not required at the moment.

## Next Steps
You now have direction for meeting and sustaining your Life Pillars. But your lifetime has limited time and effort. You need to have a focused Discipline; something that gives your live meaning. See [[12 üîÇ Convergence to Ikigai|Convergence to Ikigai]]
