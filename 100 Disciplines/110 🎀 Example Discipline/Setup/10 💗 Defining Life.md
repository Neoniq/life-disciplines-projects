# ðŸ’— Defining Life
## Preface
These notes in this folder is a guided setup on how to define your Life Pillars, Life Dynamic, and relevant Disciplines. These elements are what all action moving forward will work towards. You should set these up first, as Disciplines may be difficult to adjust later, especially if you're unfamiliar with Obsidian and its community plugins.

You do not have to go through all steps of this document, especially when things seem trivial. The only exception is that you must set up Disciplines.

If you're just giving this framework a try, feel free to speedily go through the motion. Alternatively, skip to [[11 ðŸ”€ Divergence to Disciplines#Next Steps]] to set up Disciplines.

## Life Pillars
Life Pillars are [[Pillars]] under the context of everyday Life. They are extremely personalized and give Life meaning and direction. They should be defined in the most generalized, fundamental form as possible. 

> In other words, your objective is not that you not need a hammer and nail to hang a picture, it's that you need to make something visible.

You can have any amount of Life Pillars, but do consider having just a handful so you can always remember them.

Your Life Pillars also may not reflect you now, and that's fine. As a matter of fact, it's better to define these Life Pillars to be what you want to become.

### What To Do
Go to [[99 ðŸ’— Life#Life Pillars]] and just start defining your Life Pillars. It doesn't matter if you don't have a firm idea. You just have to start externalizing, you will reach it naturally, with time.

Some example of pillars are as follows.
- Be a good human-being
- Family (or friends) first
- Pay all forms of debt, including social debt

Be sure to elaborate on what you mean by the pillar, as well as expand on this pillar's relevance and importance to yourself.

If you're stuck generating your Life Pillars, consider how you personally feel about some of the questions below. If applicable, consider their opposite, and question if it's something that should even matter to begin with.
- How do you love?
- What does the world need?
- What is your version of hell? Of heaven?
- What does it mean to live?
- How do you give back to the world?
- What are your limits?
- What does it mean to be human?
- What deserves respect and appreciation?
- What comes first?
- Do you value the journey or the end?
- What do you want before you die?
- Why are you even doing this right now?

## Life Dynamic
Life Dynamic is the emerging result of the combined effects of your Life Pillars. Pillars are the founding principles of what make you, you. They all pull you towards some direction, and this direction should agree with what you want. You could consider this your personality. That being said, your Life Dynamic should align with the Life Pillars you defined above.

Your Life Discipline should be summarized into one sentence, and should thoroughly describe a personality. This is a personality that you currently are or strive to be.

See [[Dynamics]] for more details on Dynamics.

### What To Do
Determine the emerging result of your Pillars. Define this under [[99 ðŸ’— Life#Life Dynamic]].

## Another Iteration
Take a short break.

- [ ] I took a break to refresh my mind to have a fresh perspective when I come back

Look over your Life Pillars and Life Dynamic. Really ponder over if you agree with everything. Make revisions as needed.

## Next Steps
With your fundamental life principles out of the way, you can now define direction towards them. See [[11 ðŸ”€ Divergence to Disciplines|ðŸ”€ Divergence to Disciplines]].
