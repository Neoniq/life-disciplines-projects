## The Future
###  Long-term goals are a double-edged sword because once they are met, velocity and direction disappear. One solution is to play the infinite game.

Does your Ikigai Discipline have pillars and a discipline that have considered infinite potential for growth?**

## Epilogue
This is the end of this exploratory life exploration setupf or LDP. You should a diverse set of Disciplines under your belt that you can now create Projects off of. Consider doing another pass on the Disciplines to define all of their Pillars and Dynamics if not already done.

You can archive `Setup` into `900 Archive/Projects` for historical data. 

Start making Projects that align with Disciplines to create velocity towards your Life Pillars and Dynamic. They should have a Dashboard as well, which should deine the project's Objective and completion criteria.
