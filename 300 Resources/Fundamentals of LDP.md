## Fundamentals of LDP
### Core Components
#### Tasks
[[Tasks]] are items of action that have an estimated work time less than 2 hours. Anything more can lead to increased friction and reluctance to take on.

Tasks are everywhere in the system. They can be part of general Life, Disciplines, or Projects.

Tasks should especially be clear and simple. It should be obvious when it is complete. If not, you need to further clarify the task.

#### Life
[[Life (LDP)|Life]] is the foundation in which everything you do is based on. LDP is meant to create mobility towards your Life [[Pillars]] and Life [[Dynamics|Dynamic]]. It is who you idealy want to be, not just who you are now.

[[Ikigai]] is a concept that literally translates into "a reason for being". With this in mind, you want to find this ikigai and define it as a Discipline.

Life is infinite but ever changing.

#### Disciplines
[[Disciplines]] are a broad range of skills you find relevant and important. This is what sets the direction for your Life, with a very small few defined as your Ikigai; ikigai(s) should point in the same direction.

Simialr to Life, Discipines also have Pillars and Dynamics. 

Disciplines are infinite so long as they are relevant and important.

> I personally think everyone should consider Well-being and Finance part of their disciplines.

#### Projects
[[Projects]] are derived from Disciplines. If Disciplines defined the direction, Projects actually generate the speed, creating velocity.

Projects have a single objective, which should uphold or to make progress towards a Discipline's Pillars or Dynamics. Similar to Tasks, they should also have some sort of Completion Criteria to denote when this project is clearly completed.

Projects should take no longer than an estimated month of work and no shorter than 8 hours to complete. *This is merely a suggestion to reduce friction.*

#### Alignment
Alignment is a process of check-and-balances that you do to make sure that work is relevant to it's higher-ordered context. In essense, you want to ask yourself the following.

> "Is this task, project, or discipline relevant in this context?" 
> — <cite>You, probably</cite>

For Tasks, you would align the work itself to a Project's Objective. For Projects, you with align its Objective with its Discipline's Pillars and Dynamics. Disciplines's Pillars and Dynamics align with that of your Life. Your Life aligns with your ideals.

> **Tasks $\rightarrow$ Projects:** Daily
> **Projects $\rightarrow$ Disciplines:** Weekly
> **Disciplines $\rightarrow$ Life:** Quarterly
> **Life $\rightarrow$ Sense of Self:** Yearly

This is something that should be done routinely or as neded to smooth out workflow.

The exact methods of how you align are up to you, but the main point is to make force an objective perspective to ensure you're on focused.

### Organization, Simplified
![[Habits, Life, Disciplines, Projects.drawio.png]]

LDP is organized hierarchicaly as to allow routine alignment of each component to it's higher context. Projects should make sense under Disciplines, and Disciplines should make sense in the context of your Life. And of course, your Life should make sense with your ideals.

Tasks are scattered throughout the system as needed.

### Workflow
#### Setup
There's a moderate amount of overhead before this system becomes flows like butter. You first need to understand the [[#Core Components]].

Once understood, while taking into account [[#Philosophy - How to Approach LDP|LDP Philosophy]], there are three approaches you can take.
1. Bottom-up
	- Start from your current ongoing tasks and projects and derive a discipline that contains those items. Once you cannot make any more disciplines, you can then define what kind of life a person would need to perfect those disciplines. This is useful if you haven't done much personal exploration.
2. Top-down
	- Start defining what you find to be valuable when navigating life. From this, what kind of disciplines would a person have to uphold that kind of charcter. Projects and tasks will organically form as needed. Useful if you really hold dear certain values.
3. Wide and Flat **(Recommended)**
	- Do top-down and bottom-up at the same time to find a middle ground. It gives insight as to who you are now and who you want to be. You may find a mismatch in who you want to be and who you are now, and that's completely fine.
