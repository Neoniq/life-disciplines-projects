# Philosophy - How to Approach LDP
## Build a System that Works for You
Do not blindly follow me for the easy way out. **My life is not your life.** You are helping no one, especially yourself. 

LDP is a **framework**. It's a foundation that is to be built by whoever utilizes it. You should always be asking the following two questions.
- "Why is something the way it is?"
- "How can I transform so it works even better for my needs?"

> You should be asking yourself this for everything I say.

## Keep It Clear, Simple, and Small
You should be able to sit down and immediately do what you want to do. 

LDP relies heavily on the idea of reducing [[Friction]]. This is one of many forces that push back when you try to do what you want to do. What you build from LDP should be clear, simple, and small.

> No one wants to do work that takes days to complete. On the other hand, work for 30 minutes doesn't sound too bad.

## Work in Passes
Do something, literally anything, that makes progress. Do the bare minimum now to establish structure and viability. You can always come back later to iterate on the ideas and do polish.

This idea comes from [[Agile Project Management|Agile]] and it's derivative workflows, [[Scrum (Agile)|Scrum]] and [[Kanban (Agile)|Kanban]]. 

## Work Wide, not Deep
 Work on everything at once to understand the bigger picture, then start to polish and tweak. Do not perfect one component and neglact work on the rest. Do not go deep without confirming the truth. Don't put all your eggs in one basket. 

For life-management, you are creating a [[Systems Thinking|System]]. Each component in a system multiplies with each other to create emergence and dynamics. 

> A set of chairs and a table combine to create a space of for common social ground. 

You have limited resources. Your continuous work on one component is additive with diminishing returns; reaching perfection is infinite.  

> A perfect set of chairs does not go well with a sub-par table.

## Everything should be Relevant and Important
Save time and energy by working on the relevant and important. This is an idea borrowed from [[Minimalism]] to reduce noise and enhance focus.

You don't need a hammer and nail to put up a picture. What you need is a way to have something you value easily within view.

You also need to make sure everything makes sense given it's higher context.
