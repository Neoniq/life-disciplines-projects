# Eisenhower Matrix
The **Eisenhower Matrix** is a simple, low-overhead method of prioritizing [[Tasks]]. Tasks are sorted as Important, Urgent, either or or neither.

|                   | Urgent                   | Not Urgent         |
| ----------------- |:------------------------ |:------------------ |
| **Important**     | Do these now             | Schedule for later |
| **Not Important** | Delegate to someone else | Never do           |


## Variations
### Scope
Usually the Eisenhower Matrix is applied such that its scope includes all minuscule, useless items and all crucial items. The former are considered Not Urgent, the Latter considered Important and situationally Urgent.

To reduce overhead even further, it's recommend to never note, but still consider, the minuscule, useless items.

### No Delegation
The Eisenhower Matrix assumes that you can Delegate a task to someone else. However, for certain [[Disciplines|Discipline]] this isn't possible. In this case, Urgent tasks should take priority over Important tasks, especially as the deadline approaches.

### Individualized
It may be better to follow a matrix more centered around one's self and/or needs-and-wants. This combines a shifted Scope with no Delegation.

|                   | Urgent                               | Not Urgent                                        |
| ----------------- |:------------------------------------ |:------------------------------------------------- |
| **Important**     | Critical, do these now               | Crucial, do when not pressured and abled exerted |
| **Not Important** | Pressured, do as the date approaches | Relevant, do when there's nothing else to do      |

Note that there is not a place for Tasks that you never do. This reduces overhead as stated under [[Eisenhower Matrix#Scope]], but also allows for *nice to haves* along side the mission critical items.

It is possible that useless items creep into Not Urgent and Not Important, so it's important to have some kind of realignment system in place to ensure all Tasks remain relevant.

## Expanded Definitions
### Urgent and Important
A task considered **Urgent** and **Important** are time sensitive and major hallmarks of said [[Projects|Project]].

**This takes priority #1.**

### Urgent
A task is considered **Urgent** if not accomplishing this task would lead to repercussion. This includes blocking other tasks and social, personal, and economical consequences (e.g. logging data now rather than later, how not to lose hair).

**This takes priority #2.**

### Important
A task is considered **Important** if completing this task will result in novel knowledge or substantial progress towards a Project or Area of Responsibility (e.g. timed meals under *health*, iteration on a system for *gamedev*). They can also be thought of as the *needs*, *core*, *foundations* of a project rather than the *wants*, *nice-to-haves*.

**This takes priority #3.**

### Not Urgent and Important
These are tasks that are still related, but are non-consequential and/or not immediately important to any ongoing Project or Areas of Responsibility (e.g. cooking better food, how to do a backflip, buying trivial things). They can be considered *nice to haves* or *wants* for a project.

**This takes priority #4.**
