# Friction
**Friction** in Workflow refers to the reluctance or barrier one has towards an activity. Friction can be the result of many things, but the primary cause is based on the Environment and psychology 

With no Friction, one should be able to immediately sit down and begin their work. 

With Friction, and particularly lots of it, one might sit down, look at their work, and immediate look away, think about something else, or even just walk away and not do it. This is Procrastination.

## Why it Occurs 
### Environmental Friction in Habits
[[Habits]] are a great example of how Friction affects work. Let's say you want to start exercising every two days, and let's say there's two scenarios.
1. You don't have a specific spot in your house to exercise so when you do to exercise, you make a clearing. You just start exercising right away, doing what you already know and looking up a few videos and work your way up. You revert the clearing once you're done because it needs to be there.
2. You take a week to prepare, make an exercise habit tracker, research what exercises you will do, clear a specific spot and keep it cleared, then start exercising.

Out of these two scenarios, the Scenario (2) is much more likely to succeed than Scenario (1).

This is because for Scenario (1), before you can start exercising, you must clear the space. This already raises a lot of problems, because before you can exercise, you must do something that is not exercise. This is referred to as [[Overhead]]. The more Overhead you have, the much less likely you are to do something. Looking up videos and watching them is additional overhead.

Scenario (2) attempts to prepare as much as it can before exercise starts. It attempts to reduce overhead as low as possible so that when it's time to exercise, they can exercise and there's not reason to give themselves excuses (e.g. didn't want to make a clearing).

### Psychological Friction in Rewards
[[Dopamine]] is a particularly key neurotransmitter in the way we think and why we do things. 

If one plays an engaging, potentially rewarding video game all day, the mind gets flooded with Dopamine. Neuronal pathways of said game become enhanced and continuously fire off even when not engaged in the game. This is why you sometimes have dreams of games after playing them long enough. But outside of sleep, when trying to do work, all you can think about is playing that game.

What's even worse is that your brain has adjusted it's feeling of reward. Feelings are a subjective spectrum, but what's to note here is that the brain builds tolerance of recent rewards.

If for the past month you have been playing video games non-stop and you want to do work, your brain will ask you why? Why do work, something that's so much less rewarding than video games? You will absolutely feel bored when doing your work.

Conversely, if you have been doing work for the past month and nothing else that's more *fun*, work to you is fun. That's the only fun you've had and the most fun you've had that past month (assuming work is engaging and *fun*).

## Reducing Friction
That being said from [[Friction#Why it Occurs - Friction in Habits|above]], Overhead should be reduced as much as possible on the activity that needs to get done. It should be easy to start working and difficult to stop working because you're already working.

If you find yourself constantly thinking about more rewarding things when you're sitting down to do your work, it's possible you have Dopamine Poisoning (tolerance) and your brain is overly engaged for too long on a particular activity. Consider doing a [[Dopamine Detox]].
