# Scrum (Agile)
**Scrum** is one of many methodologies build under the principles laid out by [[Agile Project Management|Agile]]. As such, teams are encouraged to self-organize and work in increments, eventually learning through experiences. They will routinely reflect on work and improve workflow.

Scrum limits teams to 7-10 (though 4.6 is perfect according to [Hackerman and Vidmar](https://www.atlassian.com/agile/scrum/scrum-of-scrums)). This to allow team members to create trust, respect, and alignment. Larger teams typically have a harder time doing this and will even naturally segment into smaller social groups. Scaling Scrum then becomes a problem, and is solved via [[Scrum of Scrums]]. Scrum can be done in-person or remotely (see [[Distributed Scrum]]).

One person is denoted as the [[Scrum Master]] to lead the charge. This person mainly mandates the [[Ceremonies (Scrum)|Ceremonies]] that take place during the sprint (e.g. meetings). 

[[Sprints (Scrum)|Sprints]] and their [[Artifacts (Scrum)|Artifacts]] are a core element of Scrum that actively partition work into manageable, iterative chunks.

Work generated and organized for Scrum can be described as daily work, the bigger picture, and the vision. See [[Work Hierarchy (Scrum)|Work Hierarchy]] on how work is organized. All if not most of this to-do work is placed on the [[Sprint Backlog]], whose items are derived from the [[Product Backlog]].

[[Scrum Metrics]] are a means to measure performance.

Another popular iteration of Scrum is [[Kanban (Agile)]]. To better understand comparisons between the two, see [[Kanban vs Scrum]].
