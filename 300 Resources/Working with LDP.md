# Working with LDP
Typical workflows are as follows. There is no particular ordering of the groupings below.

## I have found an area of skills I'm interested in and would like to invest my resources into it.
Create a new discipline and start fleshing it out.

## I have to get something done but it's not yet in the system. 
Would this take longer than 2 hours?
- If yes, consider the following
	- Break it down into elements smaller than 2 hours, then ask the question for each element, or...
	- Turn it into a Project
- If no, add it as a Task in the system within the proper context

## I have some random thoughts or need a workspace to organize ideas.
Create a note in the lowest-ordered context folder (or a global Inbox) and start rambling. 

In other words, if you have thoughts about an ongoing project, put those thoughts in that project. If you have thoughts about a discipline, not relating to any ongoing projects, put it under the discipline.

## I finished my task and/or have time to do work.
Look at any of your incompleted Tasks in the system and choose a small set (<3) that can fit your time constraint. Set it as **Ongoing** and work on it, or...

Look for any existing **Ongoing** Task. Work on it.

## I need to make sure my work is still relevant.
Do [[#Alignment]].

##### I have a Task that is no longer relevant.
Delete it if it has absolutely has potential for relevance in the future. And if it has potential, archive it.

## I just finished a Project. I also have a Project or Discipline that's no longer Relevant.
Move it to an Archive section so it's out of your way when you looking at everything else.
