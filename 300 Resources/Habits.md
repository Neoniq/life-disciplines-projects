# Habits
A **Habit** is a routine behavior that tends to occur subconsciously. This behavior is usually initiated by various circumstances, including but not limited to...
- Physical Environment
- Time
- Bodily cycles
- Mental State

## Why they Occur
The primary factor in why Habits form is due to [[Dopamine]]. Dopamine is responsible for your wants and desires, and once released consistently enough, the brain recognizes that this Habit is desirable and begins to subconsciously crave for it and do the **Routine**.

The brain recognizes the circumstances that are required to initiate the Routine. This is the **Cue**.

Sometimes these cravings are strong and Habits become compulsory. This can be especially troublesome for bad Habits (e.g. nail biting, video games, drinking, smoking, etc).

## Developing Habits
A big factor as to if Habits stick or not are if there is low enough [[Friction]] and if there lies some reward at the end of the Routine.

One should aim to reduce the amount of Friction required to initiate the Routine. There are various techniques to achieve this.
- **Plan:** plan exactly what will be done and have the routine visually in front of you as you followX as low [[Overhead]] as possible and plan for weeks in advance.
- **Setup**: have your physical environment already and keep it like that.
- **Timeblock**: have an explicit timeframe where this Routine will take place. Even better, you can do Habit Stacking, which is when you add this Routine after or before an existing Habit (e.g. brushing your teeth, waking up, etc.).
- **DND**: have nothing else planned; prevent distractions.
- **Order Matters**: Do not have extremely rewarding activities precede a lesser rewarding Habit. Your brain will question why you're doing something less rewarding. If you must, give some buffer space to become *bored* and reset reward levels.
- **Consistency**: Be consistent with all the above, especially time.

> It should be noted that **your brain needs to recognize the routine itself as rewarding.** If you give yourself an irrelevant reward, say ice cream, after a routine, your brain might not reward the routine, but reward the ice cream. You will now have cravings for the ice cream and not the routine itself.

### What to Expect
The first few sessions may feel like a honeymoon. If it's something you're motivated by, that implies that your brain already recognizes it as rewarding. However, that may be just for now. Soon, or even right now, it can feel like an immense amount of work.

Your brain has yet to recognize that this Habit is rewarding enough to be remembered. Much of the initial Habit formation requires a lot of explicit drive, as it has yet to be driven subconsciously. It will be difficult, and you will want to do other things, but you must be aware that these are merely cravings.

You are on this Habit Formation because you believe it will benefit you. These cravings to do other Habitual things may not be that good for you. Stick to what you planned to do; take control.

### Systems, not Goals
Goals are reached and then end. Systems are forever given sufficient input. This isn't to say that Goals are bad, but rather, goals should supplement Systems. As a matter of fact, you could say that a Habit is an emerging result of having a good system set up. See [[Systems Thinking]] for more on this mindset.

To set up a System for Habit, consider the following elements.
- Accountability: How often did you do the habit?
- Scheduling: When will you do the habit?
- Reminders: Alarms for when you should do the habit.
- Journaling: For reflection, analysis, ramblings, etc

## How long until it sticks?
For a Habit to truly stick, it may take anywhere between 18 and 254 days. It mainly depends on how rewarding and much [[Flow]] the routine generates. On average, it may take 66 days for the behavior to become subconscious.

Habits make up you. They make up your lifestyle. Take control of your habits and you take control of your life.
