# Burnout
**Burnout** is the state of mental and physical exhaustion caused by an intense prolonged mental stress. This intense prolonged stress can be the result of high working hours, prolonged intense focus, prolonged toxic relationships, and more. Many people have difficult sleeping, irritable, close-minded, and less productive. This loosely shares similar symptoms of [[Depression]].

It's believed that burnout is the result of a low reward insufficient for the work put in. Biologically, it could mean that the balance of [[Cortisol]] is too high compared when compared to [[Dopamine]].

> While this sounds reasonable, I don't really understand it. While (my) the potential explanation on a biological level could make sense, other than that it doesn't.

> Let's think of this the other way. Given a high reward and low effort results in elevated levels of Dopamine, leading to excessive activity of the [[Default Mode Network]] (e.g. cravings and "excuses"). The brain and body would have learned how to get the best reward for the least effort, leading to lower concentration of tasks that require more effort. While you don't get burned out, you get "Dopamine Poisoned".

> Now the inverse of that, low reward and high effort, would result in a suppression of Dopamine? Since the body/brain has learned that this task isn't rewarding, Dopamine levels drop. When going to other tasks, Dopamine levels come back since it isn't that unrewarding task. Perhaps the reason why we need a break from work is to get the body/brain to unlearn that the unrewarding task is unrewarding and to allow Dopamine to be released when doing that task. Essentially, it's the reverse of tolerance. This explains why burnout is specific to a certain activity.

Careers that are more likely to cause burnout are the following: Social Workers, Teachers, School Principles, Lawyers, Police Officers, Retail Workers. It's inferred that most of the time these jobs do not provide enough gratification to justify the work put in.

When we are stressed, we release [[Adrenaline]] to prepare and take action. However, our Adrenal Glands only have so much in reserves. Once empty, Cortisol gets released. Too much of this Cortisol can begin to impact cognition. Doing activities other than the stressful activity, especially lesser stressful activities, lowers Cortisol and helps mitigate burnout.

## Outdated
**Burnout** is the result of chronic exposure to a a single or many related stressors. This is typically related to work because a majority of our awake time is spent working. This means that burnout can also occur when doing leisure, which is thought to negate burnout. In reality, what negated the burnout was having a varied stressors that is unrelated to the previous stressors.

> Meditating does not appear to mitigate burnout, but it may postpone it.

According to the limits of [[Absolute Focus]], [[Deep Work]] should be limited to 4 hours, up to 6 if well trained. Going over this daily softcap could potentially lead to burnout.
