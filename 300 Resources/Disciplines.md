# Disciplines
A **Discipline** is a pathway of [[Ikigai]]. Disciplines have a set of values, called [[Pillars]] that when combined forms a Dynamic. A **Dynamic** is a greater goal or meaning that is the resulting effect of Pillars. The Dynamic is what drives future projects and Ikigai.

## Scoping
Disciplines are unique such that there is no majority overlap in skill-set or setting.

For example, Game Development and Programming can be separate Disciplines because although Game Development involves Programming, Programming does not largely involve Game Development.

On the other hand, Physical Health and Mental Health go hand in hand and largely affect each other. In this case, both Disciplines should be grouped as Health. You can also argue that Health is a part of a bigger picture: Well-Being.

## Relations
Disciplines are immediately related to your Life through Ikigai, as Disciplines are the components of one's lifestyle.

[[Projects]] are directly derived from Disciplines. Projects that are multidisciplinary should strongly fit into a single Discipline. If not, it's possible Disciplines are not scoped correctly or that the Project is not well defined.

[[Tasks]] will always be a part of Disciplines.

## Tags
The second index of the `tags` fields inside of the YAML must be the tag designated as the Discipline Tag.

## Pillars
A Discipline must have explicitly user-defined Pillars. There should be around 3-8 Pillars in total. These Pillars can be anything so long as they follow the following restrictions.
- All Pillars when viewed together should soundly resemble the Discipline
- The Discipline should not strongly overlap with another existing Discipline in their repository

### Examples
For the Discipline Work, Pillars might be as follows.
- **Human**: Mental Health, Physical Health, and Family comes first before Work
- **Autonomy**: Work for yourself, not for others
- **Golden Rule**: Everyone is dealing with the same shit you're dealing with, so treat them well as you want them to treat you
- **Marathon**: Stay at a steady pace as to not induce Burnout

Having Disciplines Social and Work are fine, but having Disciplines Social and Family may run into issues if you internally viewed both as the same.

## Dynamics
Dynamics are ripped from [[Mechanics-Dynamics-Aesthetics#Dynamics|MDA]]. When applied to the Pillars in Disciplines, the idea is that the whole is greater than the sum of its parts. From [[Systems Thinking]], this is the same idea as Emergence.

Pillars when applied in parallel create greater meaning. This greater meaning is the Dynamic. 

**All Disciplines should have a Dynamic, but the Pillars should come first.**

## Alignment
Disciplines should be routinely reviewed to ensure that the Pillars and Discipline are still relevant to your current life. It's suggested to do this review on a monthly basis.

## Tags and Sub-Disciplines
All Disciplines will have a tag associated with it. This tag is to be applied to all Projects and Tasks within this Discipline.

Discipline Tags may have sub-tags as the system grows to differentiate Sub-Disciplines, but care should be taken as to correctly partition the Discipline. 

The Discipline is correctly partitioned into it's Sub-Disciplines when...
- Any Project can only ever strongly fit into one Sub-Disciplines
- There is no *Miscellaneous* or *Other* Sub-Discipline

## Folders and Organization
Disciplines should have their own dedicated folder. 

It's suggested to NOT have dedicated folders for Sub-Disciplines, as examples such as Physical Health and Mental Health, Sub-Disciplines of Health, at times have overlapping content, which cannot go into both folders.

## Habits
Some Disciplines (e.g. Physical Health) may require repeated tasks in order to uphold a standard. 

Successful Habits are unconsciously repeated activities. Starting off, however, it will require you to be fully conscious of your time and drive. Because of this, Habits should be explicitly planned, created, tracked, and analyzed.

Habits are performed to your schedule with the goal to enforce it into your unconscious [[Default Mode Network]].

A simple example of a Habit is a quick sketch of any unique household item every day.

See [[Habits]] for full details on how they operate.

## Ceremonies
Working on Projects within a Ceremony may *work better* with Ceremonies. 

A simple example of a Ceremony is a set of movements to warm up before Exercise on a Project that follows a new workout schedule.

See [[Ceremonies]] for full details on how they operate.
