# Atomic Habits
**Atomic Habits** are regular practices or routines that are small and easy, and are part of a bigger system of personal compound growth.

## Hopelessness
These small Habits may seem unimportant, but it's note-worthy that they are multiplicative by nature. That is, it will seem worthless at the start, but once you cross the **Plateau of Latent Potential** (below), you will begin to feel rewarded rather than disappointed.

## Compound Growth
Let's assume that you get better 1% every year. Conversely, let's assume a different scenario where you get worse 1% every year. Let's also assume that the habits you partake in are diverse and multiplicative of each other. With that in mind, we can create the graph below.

Atomic Habits are that 1%, and you should work to remove the bad Habits and substitute good Habits.

## Identity and Behavior
Habits are initially viewed as trivial, but they are a difficult beast to tackle because the beast is one's self. As a result, we try to change the wrong thing and in the wrong way.

Actions start from the center and flow outwards, with Habits ending at the Outcome. That is, based on our Identity, we flow through a Process to reach a desired Outcome.

In order to have a desired outcome, change must occur at the root of the cascade so it's driven in the right direction.

**The best way to change your habit is to understand what kind of person you wish to become and embody it.** Everyone else, including yourself, sees you from the outside in. You must reverse this thinking, as only you can see from within outwards.

Habits identify you and your beliefs.

## Sticking Habits
Repetition of an activity causes you to be more efficient and automatic. In the brain, **Long-Term Potentiation** is occurring, strengthening the neural connections correlated to said activity. The brain literally physically changes and can increase gray matter. Each time you repeat a Habit, putting in your reps for a stronger encoding of script.

The exact duration of how long you need to deliberately stick to a habit does not matter. What matters is how long the brain well-automates it.

> Aside: The more rewarding a Habit is, the more likely the brain is to automate it. Additionally, if you can induce [[Flow]] and positive emotions, that may help as well.

## Reinforcement
**Reinforcement** refers to the added immediate gratification towards an immediately unrewarding Habit. This hacks the brain and discourages it from pushing the immediate Habit away and increases the rate of behavior. This is especially important when it comes to denying Habits.

Say for example you're on Keto, and you're trying to avoid sugar sweets in the house. Every time you have an urge to eat the sugar sweets and successfully walked away without so, reward yourself a bit. This reward should not satisfy the immediate craving. Rather, it is a reward is for denial. Your brain will recognize that not partaking in something is preferred and more rewarding.

It's important that these rewards shouldn't conflict with existing Habits. If you exercise, do not reward yourself with food.

## Formation
Habits have four components. For a habit to be successful, you must support these components.
- Cue
- Craving
- Response (Routine)
- Reward

### Cue - Make it Obvious
Set your environment to trigger the cue.

The environment has a large effect on your brain's recognition of a Habit. The environment is usually something you have better control over, compared to willpower and motivation.

### Craving - Being Irresistible
Habits are based on your brain's response to [[Dopamine]]. A well-established Habit has a Dopamine-driven feedback loop, where Dopamine rises before activity occurs. This is the **Craving** as seen on (B) below.

![[Pasted image 20211001111734.png]]

Starting off, your brain has yet to see the new Habit as rewarding; you won't have a craving. You might even have a dip around the Reward. What we want to do is to get into (A). Once the brain recognizes that something is rewarding, you will attain the Craving (B). To get there, the Habit should be irresistible.

The best way to make a Habit irresistible is to enhance the user experience. A good example is to do something you like passively while going through the motion of the habit. You can exercise while listening to your favorite music or watching a casual episode of Anime. This is called **Temptation Bundling** and can be used in tandem with Habit Stacking.

Temptation Bundling works as follows.
1. After *this habit*, I will do a *habit I need*
2. After doing a *habit I need*, I will do a *habit I want*

Going back to the diagram above, Temptation Bundling gets you to (D), which is where the brain begins to recognize the activities before the rewarding *habit I want* as potentially rewarding.

You can also increase temptation by rewarding the Habit. For exercise, you can look into purchasing an excellent exercise mat. You already sunk some money in, you also sunk it into a quality product. Why would you not exercise? 

Alternatively, you can leverage social networks as a reward. This makes sense since most Habits exist to begin with due to three social pulls.
1. Intimate opinion (family and friends)
2. Popular opinion (majority of society)
3. Powerful opinion (leaders, authority, etc)

That being said, if you can explicitly leverage the response of Dopamine any of the social pulls, and you become accepted, it can win approval, respect, praise, etc., and we find that rewarding.

### Response (Routine) - Make it Easy
Minimize [[Friction]] with your Routine.

The **Law of Least Effort** states that human behavior will naturally gravitate towards the option of the least amount of work. Prime your environment to reduce friction for Habits you want to make.
 
 Explicitly respond given the Cue and Craving. Do it repeatedly so the eventually Routine sinks to your subconscious.
 
 If you really have a hard time reducing Friction, try changing the Response itself. Instead of doing 50 push ups, try doing 10 instead. If it's time-based, consider the **Two-Minute Rule**, which states that new Habits should never take longer than two minutes. The more the [[Ceremonies|Ritual]] is in place, the easier it is to expand it. This practices the art of showing up, and since you're already in the circumstance to do it, you will eventually do it.
 
 > “Standardize before you optimize. You can’t improve a habit that doesn’t exist.”
 > — <cite>James Clear</cite>

Habits you want to enforce should be inevitable.

### Reward - Satisfaction
The brain has trouble understanding something is rewarding when it is delayed. It seeks the immediately rewarding and avoids the immediately punishing. For a Habit to stick, it needs to feel immediately rewarding, even if it's incredibly minor.

If you can make your brain see this Habit as rewarding, it increases the chances that this behavior will be repeated.

To make a Habit feel rewarding, visually tracking it can give a sense of pride and satisfaction. Be wary of [[Goodhart's Law]], however, which merely states the tunnel vision of focuses solely on simple metrics rather than purpose.

## Stopping Habits
### Cue - Avoidance
Change your environment to discard the Cue.

As mentioned under Formation, the environment has the most effect on an existing Habit. Willpower is limited, and it's best to not be in a situation to exert it to begin with. Avoidance is always better than resistance.

### Craving - The Bright Side
Understand the disgust of this Habit and the benefits of quitting.

The Cravings you have are temporary and merely a prediction. They may not actually make you better off than you are now. This is something you must remember when these Cravings occur. Remember the benefits of quitting this Habit and it will naturally feel unattractive.

### Response (Routine) - Make it Difficult
As stated in this section's [[#Response Routine - Make it Easy|inverse]], if you want a Habit to stick you should make it easy. To stop a Habit, make it difficult.

Do it for long enough and the habit will dissolve.

Habits you want to deny should be impossible.

### Reward - Pressure
An easy way to deter a Habit is to put social pressure on yourself. Tell someone that you're going through a phase and to constantly remind you to stop doing what you want to stop doing. This will create shame. Swallow it and use it wisely.

## What Habits?
Choose habits that work with you. It should make your life easy, not a struggle. Of course, if it's too easy you become bored. You need to strike the middle zone of the **Goldilocks Rule**.
![[Pasted image 20210930152118.png]]

After successfully sticking a Habit, you must be careful of being complacent. The Goldilocks Rule promotes [[Flow]], and one should be careful not to utilize it too much. See [[Flow#Downsides]] for more details.
