# Life Discipline Projects
Life-Disciplines-Projects (LDP) is a life-management framework built within [Obsidian](https://obsidian.md/) by [uwi](https://twitter.com/uwidev).  

It's an attempt to redefine one's relationship with work by reducing [[Friction]] and increasing velocity towards their intended life's purpose ([[Ikigai]]).

LDP takes inspiration from many places, pulling the best ideas and mashing them together. Concepts included can be sourced from, but not including:
- [[Ikigai]]
- [[Getting Things Done]]
- [[Pillars, Pipelines, Vaults (PPV)]]
- [[Agile Project Management]] and it's derivatives ([[Scrum (Agile)|Scrum]], [[Kanban (Agile)|Kanban]])

> You do not need to fully understand these concepts to understand LDP, with the exception of Ikigai.

## Premise
Life-Disciplines-Projects are organized as follows.

![LDP Organization](https://github.com/blongty/life-disciplines-projects/blob/main/200%20Resources/Habits%2C%20Life%2C%20Disciplines%2C%20Projects.drawio.png)

LDP is organized hierarchicaly as to allow routine alignment of each component to it's higher context. Projects should make sense under Disciplines, and Disciplines should make sense in the context of your Life. And of course, your Life should make sense with your ideals.

Tasks are scattered throughout the system as needed.

## Approach and Philosophy
**Build a System that Works for You:** My life is not your life. LDP is a framework, the foundation that is to be built by whoever utilizes it. You should always be asking the following two questions.
>>>>>>> f15113c (Update README.md)

**Keep It Clear, Simple, and Small:** You should be able to sit down and immediately do what you want to do. Do this by reducing friction.

**Work in Passes:** Do not get stuck on perfection. Do the bare minimum now to establish structure and viability. You can always come back later to iterate on the ideas and do polish.

**Work Wide, not Deep:** Work to understand the bigger picture, then start to polish and tweak the fine details. Do not perfect one component and neglact work on the rest. Don't put all your eggs in one basket.

**Everything should be Relevant and Important**: Save time and energy by working on the relevant and important.
