# Product Backlog
The Product Backlog is a prioritized list of work based on a project's Roadmap and Requirements. Work presented this way is *pull-based*, as teams only work on what they can handle, not what the product owner pushes on to them.

Roadmaps and Requirements are based on [[Work Hierarchy (Scrum)]], with Initiatives, Epics, and Stories. The product owner should compile, organize, and present work in a way that denotes highlights relations, blocked items, context, etc.

Backlogs should be regularly maintained (groomed), reviewed before each [[Ceremonies (Scrum)#Sprint Planning|Sprint Planning]] to update since last [[Sprints (Scrum)]] and incorporate feedback.

Once large enough, it's generally advised to split work into Near-Term and Long-Term work. Near-Term items are due soon and have been mostly fleshed out with idealized [[Work Hierarchy (Scrum)#Stories|Stories]], vision, and estimations. Long-Term items are the opposite, but should still have some priority towards becoming Short-Term.

Change on the Backlog is expected, but be careful not to change it when work is in-progress as to retain focus, flow, and morale.

> **Burndown Charts** are a visual aid that denotes how much work has been done so far. Comparing this to unfinished work, one can determine if the the team is behind to decide what to cut and better prioritize.
