# Scrum Metrics
**Scrum Metrics** are points of data that can be collected during [[Scrum (Agile)]] to document and eventually analyze performance for efficiency. There are some things that can only be realized through raw data.

While you can use [[Key Performance Indicators]] as a metric, you must remember that [[Agile Project Management]] favors individuals over processes and tools, and as such, you should be looking for Customer and Team Satisfaction. Return on Investment is also an important Metric to measure.

## Metrics on Sprint Planning
Look to measure the following.
- difficulty and amount of sprint goals
- team confidence and **velocity** (productivity)
	- the number of stories completed per sprint
- type of work

## Metrics on Stand-ups (Scrum)
Look to measure the following.
- if actual progress is being made according to sprint goals
- if work is being well distributed

## Metrics on Retrospectives
Look to measure the following.
- the actual progress made and if goals were checked off
	- was everything completed way earlier than expected?
- sprint satisfaction
