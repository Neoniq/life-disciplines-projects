# Kanban (Agile)
**Kanban** is an adaptation of [[Agile Project Management]] and is a workflow methodology of continuous that uses a visual aid to help organize and limit work that may be invisible to increase work efficiency. It should be applied directly to how you currently work, not the other way around.

At the most fundamental level, a Kanban Board should have the following.

- **Visual Signals**: this includes the cards, any tags they have, and any other visual indicator that shows the type of work that is to be worked on
- **Columns**: as a means to visualize workflow e.g. To Do$\rightarrow$In Progress$\rightarrow$Done
- **Work-in-Progress Limits**: to prevent handling too much work at once and promote efficiency and focus
- **Commitment Point**: a backlog of things that will definitely and eventually be done
- **Delivery Point**: the result of work

An example of a very simple board can be seen below.

The very left **Backlog** can be thought of a [[Sprint Backlog]] for [[Scrum (Agile)|Scrum]]. Cards move from left to right as work progresses. These cards should be small enough that one can finish it within a reasonable time-frame.

Kanban is a pull system in which that is based on how much free time you have. If you have free hands, you can pull an item over from the Backlog, to Today, to Doing, and eventually, to Done.

The image above is NOT the guideline, but a recommendation. It's recommended to keep it simple.

## Limiting Work
Typically columns (e.g. Doing) on Kanban have **Card Limits** as a way to direct focus and energy to a limited amount of work. This is an attempt to decrease **Lead Time**, the amount of time a card gets from the Commitment Point to Delivery. With a lower Lead Time, more work can flow.

> There is no tried and true rule on card limits as it depends on the size of the card. But a general recommendation for teams is to take the amount of people responsible per column and multiply it by 1.5 or 2. 

In order for this limiting of work to work, the Cards added must have a consistent size. General recommendations is that a card should be no more than 16 hours of work but no less than 10 hours.

## Kanban vs Scrum Boards
[[Scrum (Agile)]] has their own board methodology, but the two are very similar despite their differences.
- Kanban is usually endless commitments while Scrum Boards have a designated start and stop for that particular board
	- That is, Kanban boards are used throughout the entire development cycle while Scrum Boards are reset for each [[Sprints (Scrum)|Sprint]]
- Team Roles are explicitly defined in Scrum while Kanban is informal
	- Both self-organize
- Kanban is generally more flexible with tasks and timing

Another popular adaptation of Agile is [[Scrum (Agile)|Scrum]]. To better understand comparisons between the two, see [[Kanban vs Scrum]].
