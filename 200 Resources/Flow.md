# Flow
**Flow** is a mental state characterized by enhanced automatic and unconscious performance during an activity. 

## Developing Flow
Flow is built from mental and physical conditioning; you can jump straight into something new and enter flow. You must be sufficiently skilled at the activity where you can automate.

## Entering Flow
Once one reaches sufficient skill to attain Flow, they have to enter it. It can be difficult to enter, but easy to get out of. One must stay engaged to an engaging task for up to 15 minutes. Any distraction (e.g. someone calling your name) can ruin Flow.

It's believed that the following are necessary, if not desired, in order to entering and sustain Flow.
- Clearly defined goals (for motivation)
- A quick way to measure progress
- Near instant feedback based on your actions
- No interruptions
- Challenging enough to not be trivial but easy enough to not create frustration

## Downsides
As much of Flow is automatic, one needs to be careful of relying too much on flow. As much becomes automated, you can become stuck, only using what you've conditioned yourself to do rather than doing something better. **This is especially troublesome when what's been conditioned is not perfect, and it will never be perfect.**

To combat this, you may need to alter the activity such that it throws you slightly out of flow. That way you can deliberately think as you do what you need to do.

You can also just take it slower and be much more deliberate. Do it enough times and you'll recondition yourself.
