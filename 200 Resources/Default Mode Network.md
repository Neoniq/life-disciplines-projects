# Default Mode Network (DMN)
The **Default Mode Network (DMN)**, also known as the **Monkey Mind** refers to the various parts of the brain that are found to be active when you are mentally *at rest*. The DMN is thought to be responsible for your sense of self. It is also thought to be responsible for daydreaming, recalling memories, and general wandering thoughts.

> Those thoughts telling you that you can't do something, or that you should do something, you can blame the DMN.

Those having trouble with their sense of self is thought to have a DMN that is too active or unhealthy. It could be linked to anxiety and depression.

The DMN is found to have lower activity when we are engaged with an activity. [[Mindfulness Meditation]] is an activity which engages the brain to focus on the immediate surroundings, attempting to actively disengage the DMN.

> It is found that avid meditators have naturally have decreased DMN activity.

Studies have shown that when people take a story in, whether it be visually through a story, auditorily through its audio, or visually through a book, the Default Mode Network is activated. From this, the Default Mode Network is believed to play a role in comprehension and remembering these stories. 

> If the story is jumbled or told in an unfamiliar language, the Default Mode Network does not activate as readily. The observers tend to actively "think" a lot more to try to comprehend, which *does* appear to impede on overall story recollection.

If one were to completely turn off the DMN and engaged in an activity, Task-Positive Network, one could be in a state of [[Flow]]. Immediately after one disengages from said activity, DMN activates, and it can take a while to turn it back off as one re-engages.

Psychedelic drugs appear to deactivate the DMN, which results in transcendence and euphoria.
