# Kanban vs Scrum
[[Kanban (Agile)|Kanban]] and [[Scrum (Agile)|Scrum]] are different takes on [[Agile Project Management|Agile]]. Both are similar in this aspect, but they have nuanced approaches and workflows that support different environments.

## Understanding Scrum
Scrum are formally structured and presented through it's [[Sprints (Scrum)|Sprints]]. 

Sprints are blocked every 2-5 weeks with clear start and end dates. 

Being more formal, it has clearly defined roles: the Product Owner, Scrum Master, and the Development Team.

Deliverable are typically released as a batch at the end of Sprints.

The Key Metric of measurement is Velocity, the number of user stories completed per sprint. See [[Scrum Metrics]].

During a Sprint, ongoing planned work is NOT to be changed. Feedback is taken into account and noted for upcoming Sprints. Change occurs between Sprints to reflect customer needs.

## Understanding Kanban
Kanban is a visualization of workflow to organize and limit work to promote [[Flow]]. In order to allow for this continuous flow, one must be adaptive to be flexible and adaptive. It's less formal than [[Scrum (Agile)|Scrum]] and can be thought as a more casual version of.

Work is continuously fed and completed at whatever pace is needed according to Lead Time demands. **Work does not typically have a fixed due date.**

The Kanban Board is managed by everyone, this is no Manager.

Work is released whenever it's done rather than in formal batches.

The Key Metric and productivity is measured by Lead Time, the time it takes for an item to get form Planned to Done.

Kanban usually has a much lower overhead than Scrum, but can be prone to being chaotic due to it's less formal nature. Input that suggests change to ongoing work can and should be applied right away if needed.
