# Systems Thinking
Systems Thinking is a methodology of thought such that a singular component, or system, is part of many other systems. It examines and analyses beyond the problem and into how other elements contribute to helping or hindering progress.

> Sociology follows a similar thought processing as Systems Thinking.

**Emergence** is defined as the Dynamics and functions that become realized when a system interacts with others. Also see [[Mechanics-Dynamics-Aesthetics#Dynamics|MDA]]

To identify Systems and reason with them, consider the following.
1. Define the I/O and the Movements
2. Define if the system is liner or circular
	- Is there no modification to the input after it goes in?
	- Does additional input affect a processing output?
	- Does the output affect the input?
3. Look for patterns
4. Find feedback loops
5. Understand checks and balances
	- Considering feedback loops, how does the system stay in control?
6. What larger system is this system part of?
