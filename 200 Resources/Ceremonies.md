# Ceremonies
**Ceremonies** (aka Habit Stacking), are sequential actions to prepare one's self for upcoming adversary. This can be as simple as just preparing for the day or preparing for several hours of deep work.

For more formal Ceremonies, particularly under the premise of [[Agile Project Management]], see [[Ceremonies (Scrum)]].
